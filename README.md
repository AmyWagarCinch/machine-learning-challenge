# machine-learning-challenge

In this scenario, over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. Data was obtained from this mission.

To help process this data, I will created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

In this homework assignment, I was required to perform the following tasks:

Preprocess the raw data
Tune the models
Compare two or more models



#####Preprocess the Data

Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
Use MinMaxScaler to scale the numerical data.
Separate the data into training and testing data.


#####Tune Model Parameters

Use GridSearch to tune model parameters.
Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.


#####Reporting

Report a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).
